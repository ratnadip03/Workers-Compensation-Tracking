# Workers Compensation Smart Contract

## Description

The Workers Compensation Smart Contract is a decentralized application built on the Aptos blockchain that automates the management and payment of worker compensation. This contract provides a transparent, secure, and efficient way for employers to register workers with fixed salaries and make regular compensation payments directly on-chain.

The contract maintains detailed records of each worker's compensation history, including their fixed salary amount and total compensation paid to date. All transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency and accountability in the compensation process.

### Key Features:
- **Worker Registration**: Employers can register workers with predetermined salary amounts

- **Payment Tracking**: Comprehensive record-keeping of all compensation payments
- **Blockchain Security**: All transactions secured by Aptos blockchain technology

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize workplace compensation management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a more transparent, efficient, and trustworthy system. We aim to eliminate traditional pain points in payroll management such as:

- **Payment Delays**: Automated smart contract execution ensures timely payments
- **Administrative Overhead**: Reduced bureaucracy through blockchain automation
